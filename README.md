# Go with InertiaJS, React, and Laravel Mix.

This repository uses [inertia-go](https://github.com/petaki/inertia-go) adapter, and also [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com/) together, 
so you can have an embed [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) SPA without building an API.

> 🚨 DISCLAIMER: Please, keep in mind that this is just an experiment. But I'm accepting PR to improve it and maybe make it a little bit more interesting.

## How to run

```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
$ go get ./...
$ go run main.go
```
